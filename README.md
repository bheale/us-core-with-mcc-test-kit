# US Core Test Kit with MCC ecare IG tests

This is the, temporary, home of an [Inferno](https://github.com/inferno-community/inferno-core) test kit
for the US Core Implementation Guide with MCC eCare Implementation Guide tests 
included from the ballot of http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcc/2023Jan/index.html. 
The tests also include US CORE [v5.0.1](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU5.0.1/)

Note, this repo is intended for the May 2023 Connectathon. There's no guarantee past the 
May 2023 Connectathon that it will be kept current. However, come back frequently till then for
updates. 

We borrowed heavily from the US CORE test kits we owe gratitude and thanks to the hard work of
the US CORE crew (and Inferno team too).

It is highly recommended that you use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run
these tests so that you don't have to configure ruby and the FHIR validator
service.

## Instructions

- Clone this repo.
- Run `setup.sh` in this repo.
- Run `run.sh` in this repo.
- Navigate to `http://localhost`. The US Core with MCC test suite will be available.
